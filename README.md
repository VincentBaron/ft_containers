# ft_containers

:warning: Project ungoing!

## Project Overview

In this project we had to reimplement from scratch the following C++ STL containers:

1. Vector.
2. Stack.
3. Map.

## What I learned

1. How C++ containers work.
2. AST Binary tree data structure.
3. TDD.
4. Iterators implementation from scratch.
